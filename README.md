Download text dumps of ComputerCraft monitors, for data analysis or something.
Not my job to tell you what to do with it.

## Usage
Install and go. All dumps are in your `.minecraft` folder, in the `monitors` folder.

It is highly recommended to **rename and review** these files before sharing them as they might contain
private information, such as server IP addresses.

Depends on CC:Tweaked.
